# CorreldAidX-Challange - LC Konstanz

In this README we elaborate on our [approach](#approach), [process](#process) and on how to use the model to [predict](#predict) and for [evaluation](#evaluation).

## <a id="approach"></a>Approach
We choose the BERT-based deep-learning approach, firstly because BERT has proven to produce state-of-the-art results for various language understanding & processing tasks - including sequence classification.
Further challenges in this CorreldAidX-Challange and especially with the Arabic language are the nuances which may result in different labels/predictions.

## <a id="process"></a>Training Process
As a base model we used the AraBERT large model with 24 layers in version 2.

## <a id="predict"></a>How to use the model
See [CorrelAid_X_Challange_Konstanz_Training.ipynb](CorrelAid_X_Challange_Konstanz_Training.ipynb).
